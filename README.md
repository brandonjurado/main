## Usage

Clone the source files of the repository and navigate into the repository's root directory. Run npm install and then run npm start which will open up a preview of the app in your default browser, watch for changes to core files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the package.json file to see which scripts are included.

#### npm Scripts

- `npm run build` builds the project
- `npm run clean` deletes the `public` directory to prepare for rebuilding the project
- `npm start` or `npm run start` runs the project, launches a live preview in your default browser, and watches for changes made to files in `src`

You must have npm installed in order to use this build environment.
