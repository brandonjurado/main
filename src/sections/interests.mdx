## Interests

<div class="interests">
  <p>Apart from being a software engineer, I enjoy my time being outdoors and maintaining a healthy active lifestyle. In the winter, I love to travel to the mountains where I spend my days snowboarding, nights at local pizzerias, snow-shoeing and enjoying the amazing views and the starry nights having escaped from a light polluted city like Dallas. During the warmer months here in Texas, I enjoy mountain biking, hiking state parks, and attending live music shows.</p>
  <p>When outdoor activities are not an option, my go-to is streaming sci-fi shows, reading personal finance (F.I.R.E.) and technical books for continued growth or gaming.  Being a nerd at heart, I also pass time reading tech forums like TechCrunch, Wired and follow FreeCodeCamp to learn new tools/programming languages and create personal projects using them.</p>
